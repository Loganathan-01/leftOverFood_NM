1. Project Overview 

FoodConnect is a transformative initiative that tackles two pressing global issues: food  waste and hunger. By leveraging cuttingedge Salesforce technology, we aim to connect  surplus food from restaurants, grocery stores, events, and households with  underprivileged communities in need of nourishment.

Our vision is simple yet impactful: to create a seamless system that ensures leftover food  is not wasted but instead redistributed efficiently to those who need it most. With  Salesforce as our backbone, FoodConnect will streamline food collection, optimize  volunteer coordination, and ensure timely delivery to designated dropoff points.Through  realtime tracking, intelligent task allocation, and insightful reporting, FoodConnect will  foster transparency and accountability across the entire process. Volunteers will find it  easier to engage, donors will have confidence in the system, and recipients will benefit  from reliable access to food.This project isn’t just about logisticsit’s about building a  culture of sharing, reducing environmental impact, and creating a replicable model for  other communities. By bridging the gap between surplus and scarcity, FoodConnectaspires to make a meaningful difference, one meal at a time
